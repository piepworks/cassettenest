# /Purpose

1. I want Cassette Nest to make it easy and fun to build a **lifelong archive of metadata** about your film photography.
2. I want to **advocate for film photography**. Giving film a little bit of the metadata we enjoy by default with digital may help.
3. I want to **earn a living** by building things that I hope will make the world a little better.

So far, this little project is created by little old me, [Trey](https://twitter.com/trey). I may change the ‚ÄúI‚Äùs to ‚Äúwe‚Äùs if that changes. üôÇ

If you build things on the web, I encourage you to build your own [Slash Purpose](https://slashpurpose.org) page!
